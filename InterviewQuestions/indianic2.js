// What is the difference between the TDD and BDD?

// What is the TDD
// Test Driven Development
// - Write a test for certain piece of functionlity
// - Running the test to make them fail
// - And then writing the code to make test Pass
// - Repeat the Process

// due to this Behaviour, TDD sometimes also called as Test First Development
// in which we are testing the code while developing it.

// * Difference

// Test-driven development
 
// Behavior-Driven Development

// 2.
 
// TDD approach is basically used for the unit of modular Framework.
 
// BDD approach is basically used with Hybrid or data-driven framework.

// 3.
 
// TDD focuses on the implementation of the system

// BDD explains the behavior of an application for the end-user

// 4
 
// Here we use programing language to write test cases like java etc.
 
// Here is use gherkin language like English

// 5
 
// This approach is basically used for a small application like application have 4 to 6 pages
 
// This approach is basically used for a big application like application have more than 10 pages.
// 6
 
// If some functionality changes then it will impact more
 
// If some functionality changes then it will impact less than TDD
